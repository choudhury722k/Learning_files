    "Most of the classification tasks are based on images and videos. We have seen that to perform classification tasks on images and videos; the convolutional layer plays a key role. “In mathematics, convolution is a mathematical operation of two functions such that it produces a third function that expresses how another function modifies the shape of one function.”\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to apply the above definition, the convolution in CNN denotes the operation performed on two images which can be represented as matrices are multiplied to give an output that is used to extract features from an image. Convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input image that results in activation, and repeated application of the same filter throughout the image results in a map of activation called feature map, indicating location and strength of detected feature in an input image."
