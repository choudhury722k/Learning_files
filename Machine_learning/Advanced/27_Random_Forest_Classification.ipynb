    "The forest is said to robust when there are a lot of trees in the forest. Random Forest is an ensemble technique that is a tree-based algorithm. The process of fitting no decision trees on different subsample and then taking out the average to increase the performance of the model is called “Random Forest”. Suppose we have to go on a vacation to someplace. Before going to the destination we vote for the place where we want to go. Once we have voted for the destination then we choose hotels, etc. And then come back with the final choice of hotel as well. The whole process of getting the vote for the place to the hotel is nothing but a Random Forest Algorithm. This is the way the algorithm works and the reason it is preferred over all other algorithms because of its ability to give high accuracy and to prevent overfitting by making use of more trees. There are several different hyperparameters like no trees, depth of trees, jobs, etc in this algorithm. Check here the Sci-kit documentation for the same. "
