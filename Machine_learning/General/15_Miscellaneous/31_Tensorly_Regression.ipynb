It provides a high-level API for dealing with deep tensorized neural networks and tensor methods. It was created in 2015 by a senior research scientist at NVIDIA Research Group named Jean Kossaifi. It was presented at the NeurIPS workshop and was later published byJean Kossaifi, Yannis Panagakis, Anima Anandkumar and Maja Pantic in a JMLR paper in February 2019."],"metadata":{"id":"y-7usxkcK983"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To read about it more, please refer [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/guide-to-tensorly-a-python-library-for-tensor-learning/) article."],"metadata":{"id":"UOdlvZbKK-dy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Installation of TensorLy\n","\n","**NOTE:** TensorLy has been developed and tested only on Python 3 version.\n","\n","Install the library using pip command:"],"metadata":{"id":"b12Y3HakLIgX"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["!python -m pip install pip --upgrade --user -q\n","!python -m pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy sklearn statsmodels tensorflow keras --user -q"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["!python -m pip install tensorly --user -q"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"1T90MGIaQgDm","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1624625030788,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3955,"user":{"displayName":"Aishwarya Verma","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiG6BREocxcd5R6rzlQGApoCsYso7BQAh63eXNz6Q=s64","userId":"06108390091304498033"}},"outputId":"8dbedc83-1832-4ba7-d55c-fc57842b53ca"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["import IPython\n","IPython.Application.instance().kernel.do_shutdown(True)"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Practical Implementation"],"metadata":{"id":"kkU4L_-YLvZ7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Tensor regression example\n","\n","  Import required libraries"],"metadata":{"id":"Hi4o0mqHMkrr"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from tensorly.base import tensor_to_vec, partial_tensor_to_vec\n","from tensorly.datasets.synthetic import gen_image\n","from tensorly.random import random_tensor\n","from tensorly.regression.cp_regression import CPRegressor\n","import tensorly as tl\n","\n","# Parameter of the experiment\n","img_ht = 25\n","img_width = 25\n","# shape of the images\n","patterns = ['swiss', 'circle']\n","# ranks to test\n","ranks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","\n","# Generate random samples\n","rng = random_tensor(1)\n","X = tl.tensor(rng.normal(size=(1000, img_ht, img_width), loc=0, scale=1))\n","\n","\n","# Parameters of the plot, deduced from the data\n","n_rows = len(patterns)\n","n_columns = len(ranks) + 1\n","# Plot the three images\n","fig = plt.figure()\n","\n","for i, pattern in enumerate(patterns):\n","\n","    # Generate the original image\n","    wt_img = gen_image(region=pattern, image_height=img_ht, image_width=img_width)\n","    wt_img = tl.tensor(wt_img)\n","\n","    # Generate the labels\n","    y = tl.dot(partial_tensor_to_vec(X, skip_begin=1), tensor_to_vec(wt_img))\n","\n","    # Plot the original weights\n","    ax = fig.add_subplot(n_rows, n_columns, i*n_columns + 1)\n","    ax.imshow(tl.to_numpy(wt_img), cmap=plt.cm.OrRd, interpolation='nearest')\n","    ax.set_axis_off()\n","    if i == 0:\n","        ax.set_title('Original\\nweights')\n","\n","    for j, rank in enumerate(ranks):\n","\n","        # Create a tensor Regressor estimator\n","        est = CPRegressor(weight_rank=rank, tol=10e-7, n_iter_max=100, reg_W=1, verbose=0)\n","\n","        # Fit the estimator to the data\n","        est.fit(X, y)\n","\n","        ax = fig.add_subplot(n_rows, n_columns, i*n_columns + j + 2)\n","        ax.imshow(tl.to_numpy(est.weight_tensor_), cmap=plt.cm.OrRd, interpolation='nearest')\n","        ax.set_axis_off()\n","\n","        if i == 0:\n","            ax.set_title('Learned\\nrank = {}'.format(rank))\n","\n","plt.suptitle(\"CP tensor regression\")\n","plt.show()"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":249},"id":"Yj1rJXa6Mmb_","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1624625239528,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":541,"user":{"displayName":"Aishwarya Verma","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiG6BREocxcd5R6rzlQGApoCsYso7BQAh63eXNz6Q=s64","userId":"06108390091304498033"}},"outputId":"3e869b97-ead2-4adc-fea1-4336930959dd"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":[],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"ZcZ99z5pMqxC"}}]}
