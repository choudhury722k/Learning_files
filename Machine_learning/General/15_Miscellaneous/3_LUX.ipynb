Data exploration is the first step in any machine learning project, and it is pivotal to how well the rest of the project turns out. Although libraries like Plotly and Seaborn provide a huge collection of plots and options, they require the user to first think about how the visualization should look like and what to visualize in the first place. This is not conducive to data exploration and just contributes to making it the most time-consuming part of the machine learning life cycle. Well, what if you could get visualizations recommended to you? Lux is a Python package created by the folks at RiseLabs that aims to make data exploration easier and quicker with its simple one-line syntax and visualization recommendations. As the developers put it “Lux is built on the philosophy that users should always be able to visualize anything they want without having to think about how the visualization should look like“.
