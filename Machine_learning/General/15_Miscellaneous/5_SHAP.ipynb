SHAP works well with any kind of machine learning or deep learning model. ‘TreeExplainer’ is a fast and accurate algorithm used in all kinds of tree-based models such as random forests, xgboost, lightgbm, and decision trees. ‘DeepExplainer’ is an approximate algorithm used in deep neural networks. ‘KernelExplainer’ algorithm is, in general, applicable to any machine learning regression model. SHAP prefers different visualizations to demonstrate the feature importance and the way features contributed in predictions. In this article we discuss various SHAP visualization techniques with a decision tree classification model.
