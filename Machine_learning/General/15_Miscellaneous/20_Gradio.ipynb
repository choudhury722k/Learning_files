It is fast, easy to set up, and ready to use and shareable as the public link which anyone can access remotely and parallelly run the model in your machine. Gradio works with all kinds of media- text, images, video, and audio. Apart from ML models, it can be used as normal python code embeddings.\n","\n","Gradio is a customizable UI that is integrated with Tensorflow or Pytorch models. It is free and an open-source framework makes it readily available to anyone.\n","\n","In this practice session, we will discuss gradio with its implementation.
