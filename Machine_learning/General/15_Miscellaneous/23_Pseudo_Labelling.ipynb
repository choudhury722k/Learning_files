Here at first, a model has trained with the dataset containing labels and that model is used to generate pseudo labels for the unlabelled dataset. Finally, both the datasets and labels(original labels and pseudo labels) are combined for a final model training. It is called pseudo(which means unreal) as these may or may not be real labels and we are generating them based on a similar data model. \n"],"metadata":{"id":"pIxtXIFCpCfk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Implementation in Python\n","\n","For this demonstration, We’ve taken up the sklearn dataset breast cancer.
