This method is named as DSNE, the abbreviation for Directional Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. It can be viewed as a variant of the vanilla SNE proposed to handle velocity visualization problems such as cell differentiation and embryo development.\n","\n","DSNE converts the high-dimensional Euclidean distance between the unit-length velocity and the unit-length direction from the point of interest to the nearest neighbor points into a conditional probability distribution. This conditional probability distribution represents the similarity between the velocity and the direction of cell particles. \n","\n","To read about it more, please refer [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/complete-guide-to-dsne-a-velocity-visualization-tool/) article.\n","\n","References:\n","\n","Original research paper\n","https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08509v1\n","\n","Github Repository\n","https://github.com/songtingstone/dsne\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_QcDJzRgWOSZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Code Implementation**"],"metadata":{"id":"MYKIWdrblic_"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["!python -m pip install pip --upgrade --user -q\n","!python -m pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy sklearn statsmodels --user -q"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["!python -m pip install dsne --user -q"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"IA2zK0u5U7hh"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["import IPython\n","IPython.Application.instance().kernel.do_shutdown(True)"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Pancreas data visualization"],"metadata":{"id":"KFUofMVazXyb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","Pancreas is one of the sensitive and vital organs in the human body.
