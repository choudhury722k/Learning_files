Convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input image that results in activation, and repeated application of the same filter throughout the image results in a map of activation called feature map, indicating location and strength of detected feature in an input image."],"metadata":{"id":"y48dEpr--J9q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To read about it more, please refer [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/what-is-a-convolutional-layer/) article."],"metadata":{"id":"efoC_PEC-Kp5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Code Implementation "],"metadata":{"id":"jymEZwsU-UrQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["calculate feature map from 1D and 2D data"],"metadata":{"id":"yEYUk-wg-f4t"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["!python -m pip install pip --upgrade --user -q\n","!python -m pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy sklearn statsmodels tensorflow keras --user -q"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["import IPython\n","IPython.Application.instance().kernel.do_shutdown(True)"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["import numpy as np"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"CiNXtWvYOHtc"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["data_1D = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"y3xO3tHNOyUn"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["data_2D = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n","[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n","[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n","[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n","[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n","[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]]"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"JAj4PU4gVfXV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The input to the Keras Conv1D must be three dimensional, and for Conv2D, it must be four-dimensional.
