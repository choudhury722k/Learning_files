This makes the network blind to the uncertainties in the training data and tends to be overly confident in its wrong predictions. Consider an example where you are trying to classify a car and a bike. If an image of a truck is shown to the network, it ideally should not predict anything. But, because of the softmax function, it assigns a high probability to one of the classes and the network wrongly, though confidently predicts it to be a car. In order to avoid this, we use the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)."],"metadata":{"id":"a3WvnK8myqYE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To read about it more, please refer [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/hands-on-guide-to-bayesian-neural-network-in-classification/) article."],"metadata":{"id":"0NlHqLddytzl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Implementation**"],"metadata":{"id":"2C1n0Lasy8ek"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We will now implement the BNN on a small dataset from sklearn called iris dataset.
