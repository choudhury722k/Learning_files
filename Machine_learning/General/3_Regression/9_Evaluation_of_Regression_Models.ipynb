We use training data to train the model whereas testing data is used to compute prediction by the model. Many different algorithms can be used for regression problems but the idea is to choose that algorithm that works effectively on our data. This can be done by doing the evaluation of the model and using error metrics. Different evaluation methods are used like accuracy score, mean square error etc."],"metadata":{"id":"4sFsnnmLTH-v"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Implementation**"],"metadata":{"id":"ePx0hYq0TVzb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We will first import the required libraries that are required and load the data set.
