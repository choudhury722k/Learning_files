Time-series forecasting can be grouped roughly into two classifications based on the model outputs: probabilistic time-series forecasting and deterministic time-series forecasting.

It is named STRIPE, the acronym for Shape and Time Diversity in Probabilistic Forecasting. STRIPE consists in a structured shape and time diversity mechanism based on DPP (Determinantal Point Processes) that is differentiable. This model also has an iterative sampling mechanism to have control over diversity structure. The predictions of STRIPE fit is close to the ground truth, making the model state-of-the-art in the time-series forecasting domain."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RASwjyaYoc4j"},"source":["To read about it more, please refer [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/guide-to-stripe-shape-and-time-diversity-in-probabilistic-forecast/) article."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZGWI3Gn_oobp"},"source":["# **Python Implementation**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fxZ0KFj9oqft"},"source":["STRIPE needs a PyTorch environment.
