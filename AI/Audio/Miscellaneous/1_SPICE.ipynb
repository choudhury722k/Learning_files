This domain has received paramount attention in the past few decades due to its vitality in several fields ranging from music information retrieval to speech analysis. Traditionally what used to happen was either one could implement using time domain or frequency domain. These handcrafted models posed one problem – the need for annotated data. This is a pretty tedious and laborious task to obtain the frequency and temporal resolution required for training the model.\n","\n","Marco Tagliasacchi, a research scientist at Google Research, presented a solution to the problem mentioned above, which solved missing annotated data in November 2019. In simple basic terms, this approach calculated the relatedness between different sounds rather than calculating the absolute.  SPICE (Self-supervised PItCh Estimation) was designed on this idea and presented with the research paper."],"metadata":{"id":"SX9KAjkYcaKX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Code Implementation
