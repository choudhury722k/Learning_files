It comes with pre-trained state-of-the-art models built using Tensorflow for various types of source separation tasks. But what is source separation? Source separation can be thought of as speaker diarization but for music. The speaker diarization models have to differentiate between the voices of different speakers and then split the original audio into multiple tracks corresponding to each speaker. Similarly, the source separation models have to differentiate between the different stems(sources) of audio in a music track, these stems can be the vocals, the sound of a particular instrument, or the sound of a group of instruments. Spleeter contains pre-trained models for the following source separation tasks:"],"metadata":{"id":"kH876DAGqSWs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["> * 2 stems separation: vocals/accompaniment separation \n","> * 4 stems separation: vocals, bass, drums, and other\n","> * 5 stems separation: vocals, bass, drums, piano, and other \n","\n","It is the first tool to offer 5 stems separation.
