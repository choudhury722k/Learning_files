In continuation with that, we discuss the GUI interactions and explore the powerful real-time user control capabilities of the OpenCV library in this article. \n","\n","A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a visual system that interacts with the user directly through inputs and outputs. OpenCV displays an image or a video through a rectangular window. It also receives inputs from the user through that window by creating trackbars and reading mouse movements and keyboard taps. Thus windows in OpenCV behave as individual and independent GUIs.

In the below example, we read an image and display it in a window. If the key ‘q’ is pressed on the keyboard, the window will be closed immediately. Else, if the key ‘s’ is pressed, the image will be saved to the disk, and the window will be closed. Rather, if the key ‘g’ is pressed, the image will be saved to the disk in grayscale, and the window will be closed. Else, if the key ‘t’ is pressed, the image will be saved to the disk with some predefined texts written on it, and the window will be closed.
