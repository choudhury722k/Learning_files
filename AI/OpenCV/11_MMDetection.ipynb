It is built in a modular way with PyTorch implementation. There are numerous methods available for object detection and instance segmentation collected from various well-acclaimed models. It enables quick training and inference with quality. On the other hand, the toolbox contains weights for more than 200 pre-trained networks, making the toolbox an instant solution in the object detection domain.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aGYwt_UjIrqp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To read about it more, please refer [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/guide-to-mmdetection-an-object-detection-python-toolbox/) article."],"metadata":{"id":"5Gmx65c-5B9w"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Install MMDetection"],"metadata":{"id":"tJxJHruNLb7Y"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# Check nvcc version\n","!nvcc -V\n","# Check GCC version\n","!gcc --version"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"Wi4LPmsR66sy"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# install dependencies: (use cu101 because colab has CUDA 10.1)\n","!pip install -U torch==1.5.1+cu101 torchvision==0.6.1+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n","\n","# install mmcv-full thus we could use CUDA operators\n","!pip install mmcv-full\n","\n","# Install mmdetection\n","!rm -rf mmdetection\n","!git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git\n","%cd mmdetection\n","\n","!pip install -e .\n","\n","# install Pillow 7.0.0 back in order to avoid bug in colab\n","!pip install Pillow==7.0.0"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"gkGnB9WyHSXB"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["\n","!python -m pip install pip --upgrade --user -q --no-warn-script-location\n","!python -m pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy statsmodels sklearn nltk gensim --user -q --no-warn-script-location\n","\n","import IPython\n","IPython.Application.instance().kernel.do_shutdown(True)\n"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# Check Pytorch installation\n","import torch, torchvision\n","print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())\n","\n","# Check MMDetection installation\n","import mmdet\n","print(mmdet.__version__)\n","\n","# Check mmcv installation\n","from mmcv.ops import get_compiling_cuda_version, get_compiler_version\n","print(get_compiling_cuda_version())\n","print(get_compiler_version())"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"6hD0mmMixT0p"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Perform inference with a MMDet detector\n","MMDetection already provides high level APIs to do inference and training."],"metadata":{"id":"gi9zw03oM4CH"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["!mkdir checkpoints\n","!wget -c https://open-mmlab.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/mmdetection/v2.0/mask_rcnn/mask_rcnn_r50_caffe_fpn_mstrain-poly_3x_coco/mask_rcnn_r50_caffe_fpn_mstrain-poly_3x_coco_bbox_mAP-0.408__segm_mAP-0.37_20200504_163245-42aa3d00.pth \\\n","      -O checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_caffe_fpn_mstrain-poly_3x_coco_bbox_mAP-0.408__segm_mAP-0.37_20200504_163245-42aa3d00.pth"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"j4doHX4exvS1"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["from mmdet.apis import inference_detector, init_detector, show_result_pyplot\n","\n","# Choose to use a config and initialize the detector\n","config = 'configs/mask_rcnn/mask_rcnn_r50_caffe_fpn_mstrain-poly_3x_coco.py'\n","# Setup a checkpoint file to load\n","checkpoint = 'checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_caffe_fpn_mstrain-poly_3x_coco_bbox_mAP-0.408__segm_mAP-0.37_20200504_163245-42aa3d00.pth'\n","# initialize the detector\n","model = init_detector(config, checkpoint, device='cpu')"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"8M5KUnX7Np3h"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# Use the detector to do inference\n","img = 'demo/demo.jpg'\n","result = inference_detector(model, img)"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"Wi6DRpsQPEmV"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# Let's plot the result\n","show_result_pyplot(model, img, result, score_thr=0.3)"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"UsJU5D-QPX8L"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Train a detector on customized dataset\n","\n","To train a new detector, there are usually three things to do:\n","1.
