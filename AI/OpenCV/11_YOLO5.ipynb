For every real-time object detection work, YOLO is the first choice by Data Scientist and Machine learning engineers. YOLO algorithms divide all the given input images into the SxS grid system. Each grid is responsible for object detection. Now those Grid cells predict the boundary boxes for the detected object. For every box, we have five main attributes: x and y for coordinates, w and h for width and height of the object, and a confidence score for the probability that the box containing the object."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pbNriHGO17MV"},"source":["To read about it more, please refer [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/yolov5/) article."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ba4o0gTK5OXe"},"source":["# Implementation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JhbFrSWg5SFM"},"source":["We are going to see a starter tutorial on YOLOv5 by Ultralytics and going to detect some objects from our given image"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"boJWQ2xo5XQH"},"source":["First, clone the YOLOv5 repo from GitHub to your environment using the below command."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"m0pn7DCOzkaq"},"source":["!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone repo"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IXqKP0V_5cBw"},"source":["Install the dependencies using the pip command"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"lRz3MXeP5azv"},"source":["%cd yolov5\n","%pip install -qr requirements.txt  # install dependencies"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kayID2C15g4R"},"source":["Import some of the modules like a torch and display to display our output image inside the notebook."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iqYz9M_T5epY"},"source":["import torch\n","from IPython.display import Image, clear_output "],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2bfGHSPC5jTC"},"source":["!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmaithani/Datasets/main/1.jpg"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"aZjOIdF76acd"},"source":["!pwd"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Dp48XJcL6TJ4"},"source":["!mv 1.jpg data/images/"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hkJspf9257Bp"},"source":["Image(filename='data/images/1.jpg', width=600)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iUAiCcw45q0k"},"source":["Test using this command, detect.py runs inference on a variety of sources and will automatically download the latest model from [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uUsZA1rq5n4r"},"source":["!python detect.py --weights yolov5s.pt --img 640 --conf 0.25 --source data/images/\n","Image(filename='runs/detect/exp/1.jpg', width=600)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"kAqmGP886l9X"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
