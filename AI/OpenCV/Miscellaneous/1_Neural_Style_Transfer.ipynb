In this method, two images named as original content images and the style reference images are blended together by the algorithms. This blending is done in such a way that the resulting image looks like the original content image but painted in the style of the style reference image. This style transfer task is performed by optimizing the output image to match the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image. These statistics are extracted from the images using the feature extraction capabilities of the convolutional neural network."],"metadata":{"id":"gNuPZwZPaGv3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["There are several deep learning methods for the neural style transfer in images. But they require a heavy execution environment and consume much computational resources and time. The TensorFlow Hub module provides a class of pre-trained machine learning modules in order to save computational resources and time. It also provides the pre-trained deep convolutional neural network for style transfer in images. \n","\n","In this practice, we present a very fast and effective way to neural style transfer in images using the TensorFlow Hub module. The TF-Hub module provides the pre-trained VGG Deep Convolutional Neural Network for style transfer. This approach takes less than four seconds to transfer style to a content image."],"metadata":{"id":"_W_74KRGayZ8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Implementation**"],"metadata":{"id":"HyHJjBnha7ky"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["First of all, we will import the required libraries.
