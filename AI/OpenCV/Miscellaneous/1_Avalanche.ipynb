Avalanche is an open-source library based on PyTorch. This enables quick prototyping, training, evaluation, benchmarking and deployment of Continual Learning models and algorithms with minimal code. In contrast, Avalanche is an all-in-one Continual Learning solution driven by an open development community aiming for sharing, collaboration and improvement."],"metadata":{"id":"BYNln9wzUgCi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To learn about its architecture, please refer [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/avalanche-a-python-library-for-continual-learning/) article."],"metadata":{"id":"RapcOg-QWcoP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","References:\n","\n","Original Research Paper\n","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00405v1.pdf\n","\n","Github repository\n","https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche\n","\n","Official Tutorial\n","https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche/tree/master/notebooks/from-zero-to-hero-tutorial\n","\n","Official website\n","https://avalanche.continualai.org/\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tRPIOY1p-e_1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **SimpleMLP modeling on PermutedMNIST dataset**"],"metadata":{"id":"MSlr4l6XWkmu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Avalanche and its dependencies can be installed using the following command.
