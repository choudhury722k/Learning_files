# Policy-Gradient 

Here we implement Renforcement learning with deep learning to implement Policy-Gradient from [Paulus et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04304)
This is a library for implementing **Reinforcment learning with deep learning for text summarization** .
which has been converted to a jupyter notebook format to run seamlesly within google colab

## Description
description from [yasterk](https://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq#scheduled-sampling-soft-scheduled-sampling-and-end2endbackprop) 

[Paulus et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04304). proposed a self-critic policy-gradient model for abstractive text summarization. The following figure represents how this method works and how we implemented this method:
