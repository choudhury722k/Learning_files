    <article>marseille , france -lrb- cnn -rrb- the french prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of __germanwings__ flight __9525__ insisted wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane . marseille prosecutor brice robin told cnn that `` so far no videos were used in the crash investigation . '' he added , `` a person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators . '' robin 's comments follow claims by two magazines , german daily bild and french paris match , of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board __germanwings__ flight __9525__ as it crashed into the french alps . all 150 on board were killed . paris match and bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site . the two publications described the supposed video , but did not post it on their websites . the publications said that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation . `` one can hear cries of ` my god ' in several languages , '' paris match reported . `` metallic banging can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . then nothing . '' `` it is a very disturbing scene , '' said julian __reichelt__ , editor-in-chief of bild online . an official with france 's accident investigation agency , the bea , said the agency is not aware of any such video . lt. col. jean-marc __menichini__ , a french __gendarmerie__ spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the __germanwings__ crash site , told cnn that the reports were `` completely wrong '' and `` unwarranted . '' cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they `` had n't been exploited yet . '' __menichini__ said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the criminal research institute in __rosny__ __sous-bois__ , near paris , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators . but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , __menichini__ said . asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , __menichini__ answered with a __categorical__ `` no . '' __reichelt__ told `` erin burnett : outfront '' that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying bild and paris match are `` very confident '' that the clip is real . he noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after bild and paris match published their reports . `` that is something we did not know before . ... overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , '' he said . what was mental state of __germanwings__ co-pilot ? german airline lufthansa confirmed tuesday that co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ had battled depression years before he took the controls of __germanwings__ flight __9525__ , which he 's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the french alps . __lubitz__ told his lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a `` previous episode of severe depression , '' the airline said tuesday . email correspondence between __lubitz__ and the school discovered in an internal investigation , lufthansa said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . the announcement indicates that lufthansa , the parent company of __germanwings__ , knew of __lubitz__ 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . lufthansa , whose ceo __carsten__ __spohr__ previously said __lubitz__ was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement tuesday as a `` swift and seamless clarification '' and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . __spohr__ traveled to the crash site wednesday , where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside . he saw the crisis center set up in __seyne-les-alpes__ , laid a wreath in the village of le __vernet__ , closer to the crash site , where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial . __menichini__ told cnn late tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching . french president francois hollande , speaking tuesday , said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using dna analysis by the end of the week , sooner than authorities had previously suggested . in the meantime , the recovery of the victims ' personal belongings will start wednesday , __menichini__ said . among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board . check out the latest from our correspondents . the details about __lubitz__ 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and __lubitz__ 's possible motive for downing the jet . a lufthansa spokesperson told cnn on tuesday that __lubitz__ had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and `` held all the licenses required . '' earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf , christoph __kumpa__ , said medical records reveal __lubitz__ suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license . __kumpa__ emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting __lubitz__ was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . investigators are looking into whether __lubitz__ feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a european government official briefed on the investigation told cnn on tuesday . while flying was `` a big part of his life , '' the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told cnn that authorities believe the primary motive for __lubitz__ to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . __lubitz__ 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a __neuropsychologist__ , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the european government official said . but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said brian russell , a forensic psychologist . `` psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , '' he said . `` but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems .

    <article>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the palestinian authority officially became the __123rd__ member of the international criminal court on wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories . the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at the hague , in the netherlands , where the court is based . the palestinians signed the icc 's founding rome statute in january , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed `` in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem , since june 13 , 2014 . '' later that month , the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis . as members of the court , palestinians may be subject to __counter-charges__ as well . israel and the united states , neither of which is an icc member , opposed the palestinians ' efforts to join the body . but palestinian foreign minister riad __al-malki__ , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an icc news release . `` indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' judge __kuniko__ __ozaki__ , a vice president of the icc , said __acceding__ to the treaty was just the first step for the palestinians . `` as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine , palestine __acquires__ all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute . these are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . rights group human rights watch welcomed the development . `` governments seeking to __penalize__ palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said __balkees__ __jarrah__ , international justice counsel for the group . `` what 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' in january , when the preliminary icc examination was opened , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was __overstepping__ its boundaries . the united states also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc , '' the state department said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` palestine . '' while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . prosecutor __fatou__ __bensouda__ said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality . '' the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june . the international criminal court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . cnn 's __vasco__ __cotovio__ , kareem khadder and faith karimi contributed to this report .</article>

    <article>-lrb- cnn -rrb- governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions , amnesty international alleges in its annual report on the death penalty . `` the dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year , '' said __salil__ shetty , amnesty 's secretary general in a release . `` it is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people 's lives -- putting people to death for ` terrorism ' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence . '' the report , `` death sentences and executions 2014 , '' cites the example of pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in peshawar in december . china is also mentioned , as having used the death penalty as a tool in its `` strike hard '' campaign against terrorism in the restive __far-western__ province of xinjiang . the annual report __catalogs__ the use of __state-sanctioned__ killing as a punitive measure across the globe , and this year 's edition contains some mixed findings . on one hand , the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22 % on the previous year . at least __607__ people were executed around the world in 2014 , compared to __778__ in 2013 . amnesty 's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in china , where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret . belarus and vietnam , too , do not release data on death penalty cases . `` the long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions -lrb- worldwide -rrb- , '' audrey __gaughran__ , amnesty 's director of global issues , told cnn . `` a number of countries are closer to abolition , and there are some signs that some countries will be __abolitionist__ by 2015 . -lrb- there are -rrb- signals of a world that is nearing abolition . '' while the report notes some encouraging signs , it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014 . at least __2,466__ people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year , an increase of 28 % compared with 2013 . the report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to __mass-sentencing__ in countries including egypt and nigeria , `` against scores of people in some cases . '' the organization found `` positive developments '' worldwide , with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions . opinion : sharp spike in death sentences . sub-saharan africa , for example , saw a 28 % fall in reported cases , and executions recorded in the middle east and north africa were down 23 % compared to 2013 . `` even though we 've highlighted some of the negative developments ... i think we would always highlight that there are positive developments , '' __gaughran__ said . `` across the board , with the exception of europe and central asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region . '' the resumption of the use of capital punishment in belarus -- the only country in europe and central asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an __near-universal__ decrease in countries using the death penalty by region . the united states has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the americas to conduct executions , but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly , from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014 . the state of washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year . the u.s. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment , with only iran -lrb- 289 + -rrb- , iraq -lrb- 61 + -rrb- , and saudi arabia -lrb- 90 + -rrb- executing more people in 2014 . while figures are not available , amnesty estimates that china also executes `` thousands '' of prisoners each year , `` more than the rest of the world put together . '' the report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death . `` in the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed , the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards , '' the report stated . `` in 2014 amnesty international raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in afghanistan , bangladesh , china , egypt , iran , iraq , north korea , pakistan , saudi arabia and sri lanka . '' the united nations secretary-general , ban ki-moon , last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment . `` the taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another , '' he said , in marking world day against death penalty in october . `` we must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights . '' amnesty estimates that at least __19,094__ people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014 .</article>

    <article>-lrb- cnn -rrb- on may 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in china 's northwestern xinjiang region . but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event . instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits . armed soldiers guarded the exits . in the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed . three were sentenced to death . the public mass sentencing was part a china 's `` strike hard '' campaign against unrest in xinjiang , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat `` terrorism '' and `` separatism . '' but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide . much of it makes for grim reading . in pakistan , the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific taliban attack on a school in peshawar in december . more than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows . iran and iraq executed people for `` terrorism , '' and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes . in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism . other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates . jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in december , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime . in indonesia , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety `` national emergency . '' six people have already been executed this year . a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . the rise was largely because of developments in egypt and nigeria , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict . the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both . there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as united nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed . it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough . at amnesty international , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades . thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us . the numbers speak for themselves . in 1945 when the united nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty . today , 140 states are __abolitionist__ in law or practice . last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago . despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found . the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from __778__ to __607__ . this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine . executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-saharan africa -- equatorial guinea , somalia and sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter . the americas continued to be __execution-free__ , apart from the united states . those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history . they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment . fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment . with determination , i know that we can achieve this goal .</article>

    <article>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the rev. robert h. __schuller__ , california __televangelist__ and founder of the television ministry `` hour of power , '' died thursday , according to his family . he was 88 years old . __schuller__ , also the founder of crystal cathedral megachurch , had been diagnosed with __esophageal__ cancer in august 2013 , a release from `` hour of power '' said . `` my father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning . he was a great dad and a great man of god , '' said __schuller__ 's daughter-in-law , donna __schuller__ , in a twitter message . __schuller__ 's life followed an almost shakespearean arc . he was born in a iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days . in his autobiography , `` prayer : my soul 's adventure with god , '' he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a __rapt__ congregation . after attending a hope college and western theological seminary in michigan , he met his wife of more than 60 years , __arvella__ , while preaching at her church -lrb- she was the organist -rrb- . with their young family in tow , the __schullers__ __caravanned__ west to california , where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar . it was beneath the dignity of christian ministry , some local pastors __huffed__ . the `` passion pits '' where teenagers __necked__ was no place for the gospel . __schuller__ was undeterred , and he quickly __outgrew__ the drive-in . he called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a `` miracle , '' though his many mainstream critics had other names for it . his confident , breezy version of christianity -- too breezy , by some __estimations__ -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed christians who were put off by the hellfire __fulminations__ of many post-war american preachers . __schuller__ sold a softer , gentler message , which borrowed heavily , he acknowledged , from the father of the feel-good gospel , norman vincent __peale__ . he preached not to convert or condemn people , but to encourage them , a sentiment he called `` possibility thinking . '' people loved it . `` __evangelicalism__ at its best wants to be innovative and reach people , '' said timothy larsen , a professor of christian thought at wheaton college in illinois . `` and __schuller__ was a master at that . '' `` what he got right is that the gospel is good news , '' larsen continued . `` and he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope . '' some of __schuller__ 's favored phrases , though , struck others as __cornpone__ christianity . `` turn your hurt into a halo ? '' said randall __balmer__ , a professor of american religious history at dartmouth college , citing one such phrase . `` that 's pretty weak tea . '' still , __balmer__ gives __schuller__ some credit . `` it may be bad theology , but it 's brilliant marketing . '' in 1970 , __schuller__ began broadcasting `` hour of power , '' believed to be one of the first , if not the very first , sunday service to be shown regularly on television . with his __genial__ smile , __priestly__ robes and gray hair , he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed . the show , which ran for decades , reached millions , making __schuller__ a __televangelist__ before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors . __schuller__ 's crowning achievement , at least __architecturally__ , still stands in orange county , california , though it is now owned by the roman catholic church . the crystal cathedral , a great gleaming __edifice__ with 10,000 glass panels , gave worshipers a look at the clouds that house the heavens , while __schuller__ preached in the pulpit below . the message was clear to many : the road to the former ran through the latter . during the 1980s and 1990s , __schuller__ 's star continued to rise , with presidents stopping by the crystal cathedral -- often during campaigns , it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like rick warren and bill __hybels__ seeking his advice . as __schuller__ aged , though , his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of `` king lear . '' he tried to install his only son , bobby jr. , as pastor of crystal cathedral . but the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance . bobby __schuller__ jr. left `` hour of power '' and the pulpit at crystal cathedral after a short time . as the family searched for a new successor and __tussled__ over finances , viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped __precipitously__ . crystal cathedral ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010 , citing debts of more than $ 43 million , according to the associated press . __schuller__ 's empire , which once soared as high as his __glassy__ cathedral , had fallen to dust . eventually , __schuller__ 's grandson , also named bobby , took over `` hour of power , '' though at a different church . in a statement on thursday , the younger __schuller__ recalled standing atop crystal cathedral 's __12-story__ tower of hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape . `` you could see the whole world from there , '' he said . people we 've lost in 2015 . cnn 's stella chan reported from los angeles .</article>

    <article>-lrb- cnn -rrb- never mind cats having nine lives . a stray pooch in washington state has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car , apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive . that 's according to washington state university , where the dog -- a friendly __white-and-black__ bully breed mix now named __theia__ -- has been receiving care at the veterinary teaching hospital . four days after her apparent death , the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm , __dirt-covered__ and emaciated , where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help . she was taken in by moses lake , washington , resident sara __mellado__ . `` considering everything that she 's been through , she 's incredibly gentle and loving , '' __mellado__ said , according to __wsu__ news . `` she 's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life . '' __theia__ is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . she suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a __caved-in__ sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe . the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but __mellado__ has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care . she 's also created a facebook page to keep supporters updated . donors have already surpassed the $ 10,000 target , inspired by __theia__ 's tale of survival against the odds . on the fundraising page , __mellado__ writes , `` she is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw . i agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home . '' she is dedicated to making sure __theia__ gets the medical attention she needs , __mellado__ adds , and wants to `` make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again ! '' any additional funds raised will be `` paid forward '' to help other animals . __theia__ is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks . a cat in tampa , florida , found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in january , showed up alive in a neighbor 's yard five days after he was buried by his owner . the cat was in bad shape , with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye , but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the humane society .</article>

    <article>-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you 've been following the news lately , there are certain things you doubtless know about mohammad javad zarif . he is , of course , the iranian foreign minister . he has been u.s. secretary of state john kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . and he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in iran on a sunny friday morning . `` long live zarif , '' crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . you may well have read that he is `` polished '' and , unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues , `` jovial . '' an internet search for `` mohammad javad zarif '' and `` jovial '' yields thousands of results . he certainly has gone a long way to bring iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . but there are some facts about zarif that are less well-known . here are six : . in september 2013 , zarif tweeted `` happy __rosh__ __hashanah__ , '' referring to the jewish new year . that prompted christine pelosi , the daughter of house minority leader nancy pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own : `` thanks . the new year would be even sweeter if you would end iran 's holocaust denial , sir . '' and , perhaps to her surprise , pelosi got a response . `` iran never denied it , '' zarif tweeted back . `` the man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . happy new year . '' the reference was likely to former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by ahmadinejad 's successor , hassan __rouhami__ . his foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that `` due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the united states . '' that is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the shah of iran , which began in 1977 , and during the iranian revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from san francisco state university in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the university of denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the university of denver in 1988 . both of his children were born in the united states . the website of the iranian foreign ministry , which zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . the first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in tehran , says zarif was `` born to a religious traditional family in tehran in 1959 . '' later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as january 8 , 1960 . and the iranian diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . so he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , kerry , who is 71 . the feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the alavi foundation , a charitable organization . the u.s. justice department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the iranian government to launder money and get around u.s. sanctions . but last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a __36-story__ building in manhattan along with other properties to the u.s. government , did not mention zarif 's name . early in the iranian revolution , zarif was among the students who took over the iranian consulate in san francisco . the aim , says the website __iranian.com__ -- which cites zarif 's memoirs , titled `` mr. ambassador '' -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently islamic . later , the website says , zarif went to make a similar protest at the iranian mission to the united nations . in response , the iranian ambassador to the united nations offered him a job . in fact , he has now spent more time with kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . and that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a june 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in switzerland .</article>
