# Scheduled Sampling with intradecoder
Here we implement Scheduled Sampling from [Bengio et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099)
This is a library for implementing **Reinforcment learning with deep learning for text summarization** .
which has been converted to a jupyter notebook format to run seamlesly within google colab

## Description
description from [yasterk](https://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq#scheduled-sampling-soft-scheduled-sampling-and-end2endbackprop) 

[Bengio et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099). proposed the idea of scheduled sampling for avoiding exposure bias problem.
