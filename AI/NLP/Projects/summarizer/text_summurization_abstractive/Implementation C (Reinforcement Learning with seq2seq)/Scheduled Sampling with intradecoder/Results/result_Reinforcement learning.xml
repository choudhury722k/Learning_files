    <article>editor 's note : in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . here , soledad o'brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill . an inmate housed on the `` forgotten floor , '' where many mentally ill inmates are housed in miami before trial . miami , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the ninth floor of the miami-dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the `` forgotten floor . '' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven __leifman__ says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to __leifman__ . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with __leifman__ . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . __leifman__ says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . __leifman__ tells me that these __prisoner-patients__ will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . __leifman__ says 200 years ago people were considered `` __lunatics__ '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but __leifman__ says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . __leifman__ says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . __leifman__ says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . __leifman__ says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for __leifman__ , justice is served . e-mail to a friend .</article>

'' radcliffe 's earnings from the first five potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch . despite his growing fame and riches , the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground . `` people are always looking to say ` kid star goes off the rails , ' '' he told reporters last month . `` but i try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them . '' his latest outing as the boy wizard in `` harry potter and the order of the phoenix '' is breaking records on both sides of the atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films . watch __i-reporter__ give her review of potter 's latest '' there is life beyond potter , however . the londoner has filmed a tv movie called `` my boy jack , '' about author rudyard kipling and his son , due for release later this year . he will also appear in `` december boys , '' an australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage . earlier this year , he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in peter shaffer 's `` __equus__ .

'' he said his back was injured but he determined he could move around . `` i realized there was a school bus right next to me , and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge . they were yelling , screaming , bleeding . i think there were some broken bones . '' watch a driver describe his narrow escape '' at home when he heard about the disaster , dr. john __hink__ , an emergency room physician , jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes . he arrived at the south side of the bridge , stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck . they were in the middle of the mississippi river , which was churning fast , and he had no way of getting to them . he went to the north side , where there was easier access to people . ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene . working feverishly , volunteers , emts and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours . occasionally , a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground , __hink__ told cnn . the rescue effort was controlled and organized , he said ; the opposite of the __lightning-quick__ collapse . `` i could see the whole bridge as it was going down , as it was falling , '' __babineau__ said . `` it just gave a rumble real quick , and it all just gave way , and it just fell completely , all the way to the ground . and there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying : it was just like out of the movies .

    <article>baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- dressed in a superman shirt , 5-year-old youssif held his sister 's hand friday , seemingly unaware that millions of people across the world have been touched by his story . nearby , his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns . youssif holds his sister 's hand friday . he 's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims . it 's the best birthday present the iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy : youssif turns 6 next friday . `` i was so happy i did n't know what to do with myself , '' his mother , zainab , told cnn , a broad smile across her face . `` i did n't think the reaction would be this big . '' his father said he was on the roof of his house when cnn called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son . `` we just want to thank everyone who has come forward , '' he said . `` we knew there was kindness out there . '' like his wife , he could n't stop smiling . he talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in baghdad , leaving `` no stone unturned '' on a mission to help his boy . there were many trips to the ministry of health . he says he even put in a request to iraq 's parliament for help . the family eventually told cnn their story -- that youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on january 15 , doused in gasoline and set on fire . simply by coming forward , his parents put themselves in incredible danger . no one has been arrested or held accountable in youssif 's case . watch cnn 's arwa damon describe ` truly phenomenal ' outpouring '' shortly after youssif 's story aired wednesday , the children 's burn foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in sherman oaks , california , that provides support for burn victims locally , nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for youssif and his family to come to the united states and to set up a fund for donations . you can make a donation at the foundation 's site by clicking here . there 's a __drop-down__ menu under the `` general donation '' area that is marked `` youssif 's fund . '' the foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him . surgeries will be performed by dr. peter grossman , a plastic surgeon with the affiliated grossman burn center who is donating his services for youssif 's cause . officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family 's travels . `` we are prepared to have them come here , set them up in a housing situation , provide support for them and begin treatment , '' said barbara friedman , executive director of the children 's burn foundation . `` we expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries . '' she added , `` he will be getting the absolute best care that 's available . '' youssif 's parents said they know it 's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in america may not be easy . but none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost . `` i will do anything for youssif , '' his father said , pulling his son closer to him . `` our child is everything . '' his mother tried to coax youssif to talk to us on this day . but he did n't want to ; his mother says he 's shy outside of their home . the biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave , and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in iraq . but this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that january day -- has new hope in the world . that is partly due to the tens of thousands of cnn.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act . cnn iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border . in a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world , it was a refreshing realization . e-mail to a friend . cnn.com senior producer wayne __drash__ contributed to this report in atlanta .</article>

    <article>-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the national football league has indefinitely suspended atlanta falcons quarterback michael vick without pay , officials with the league said friday . nfl star michael vick is set to appear in court monday . a judge will have the final say on a plea deal . earlier , vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in virginia . `` your admitted conduct was not only illegal , but also cruel and reprehensible . your team , the nfl , and nfl fans have all been hurt by your actions , '' nfl commissioner roger goodell said in a letter to vick . goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over . in papers filed friday with a federal court in virginia , vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well . falcons owner arthur blank said vick 's admissions describe actions that are `` incomprehensible and unacceptable . '' the suspension makes `` a strong statement that conduct which __tarnishes__ the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated , '' he said in a statement . watch what led to vick 's suspension '' goodell said the falcons could `` assert any claims or remedies '' to recover $ 22 million of vick 's signing bonus from the 10-year , $ 130 million contract he signed in 2004 , according to the associated press . vick said he would plead guilty to one count of `` conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture '' in a plea agreement filed at u.s. district court in richmond , virginia . the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine , `` full restitution , a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release , '' the plea deal said . federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines . `` the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense , '' the plea agreement said . in an additional summary of facts , signed by vick and filed with the agreement , vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs , but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won . `` most of the ` bad __newz__ kennels ' operations and gambling monies were provided by vick , '' the official summary of facts said . gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators tony taylor , __quanis__ phillips and sometimes purnell peace , it continued . `` vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights . vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by ` bad __newz__ kennels . ' '' vick also agreed that `` collective efforts '' by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs . around april , vick , peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vick 's property in virginia , the statement said . `` peace , phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in ` testing ' sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods , including hanging and drowning . `` vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace , phillips and vick , '' the summary said . peace , 35 , of virginia beach , virginia ; phillips , 28 , of atlanta , georgia ; and taylor , 34 , of hampton , virginia , already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences . vick , 27 , is scheduled to appear monday in court , where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge . see a timeline of the case against vick '' the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement . the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy , but vick 's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges , according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin . `` it sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior , '' toobin said friday . `` the risk for vick is , if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea , the state of virginia could say , ` hey , look , you admitted violating virginia state law as well . we 're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court . ' '' in the plea deal , vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary . vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests . vick agreed to `` make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated '' with the dogs that are being held by the government . `` such costs may include , but are not limited to , all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case , including if necessary , the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals . '' prosecutors , with the support of animal rights activists , have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs . but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted co-conspirators . judge henry e. hudson issued an order thursday telling the u.s. marshals service to `` arrest and seize the defendant property , and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property . '' both the judge 's order and vick 's filing refer to `` approximately '' 53 pit bull dogs . after vick 's indictment last month , goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons training camp , and the league is reviewing the case . blank told the nfl network on monday he could not speculate on vick 's future as a falcon , at least not until he had seen `` a statement of facts '' in the case . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mike phelan contributed to this report .</article>

    <article>baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used . they have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $ 8 a day . __suha__ , 37 , is a mother of three . she says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home . `` people should n't criticize women , or talk badly about them , '' says 37-year-old __suha__ as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves . `` they all say we have lost our way , but they never ask why we had to take this path . '' a mother of three , she wears light makeup , a gold pendant of iraq around her neck , and an unexpected air of elegance about her . `` i do n't have money to take my kid to the doctor . i have to do anything that i can to preserve my child , because i am a mother , '' she says , explaining why she prostitutes herself . anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks . `` no matter what else i may be , no matter how off the path i may be , i am a mother ! '' watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to `` save my child '' '' her clasped hands __clench__ and __unclench__ nervously . __suha__ 's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away . so does karima 's family . `` at the start i was cleaning homes , but i was n't making much . no matter how hard i worked it just was n't enough , '' she says . karima , clad in all black , adds , `` my husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing . '' she has five children , ages 8 to 17 . her eldest son could work , but she 's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets , preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child . she was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office . `` they took advantage of me , '' she says softly . `` at first i rejected it , but then i realized i have to do it . '' both __suha__ and karima have clients that call them a couple times a week . other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients . or they flag down vehicles . prostitution is a choice more and more iraqi women are making just to survive . `` it 's increasing , '' __suha__ says . `` i found this ` thing ' through my friend , and i have another friend in the same predicament as mine . because of the circumstance , she is forced to do such things . '' violence , increased cost of living , and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options , according to humanitarian workers . `` at this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive , '' says __yanar__ mohammed , head and founder of the organization for women 's freedom in iraq . `` it 's a taboo that no one is speaking about . '' she adds , `` there is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies , their souls and they lost it all . it crushes us to see them , but we have to work on it and that 's why we started our team of women activists .

'' rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children : `` she has sex while her three children are in the room , but she makes them stand in separate corners . '' according to rahim and mohammed , most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in iraq . `` they took this path but they are not pleased , '' rahim says . karima says when she sees her children with food on the table , she is able to convince herself that it 's worth it . `` everything is for the children . they are the beauty in life and , without them , we can not live . '' but she says , `` i would never allow my daughter to do this . i would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this . '' karima 's last happy memory is of her late husband , when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today 's iraq together . __suha__ says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor , with her mom boasting about her potential in that career . life could n't have taken her further from that dream . `` it 's not like we were born into this , nor was it ever in my blood , '' she says . what she does for her family to survive now eats away at her . `` i lay on my pillow and my brain is spinning , and it all comes back to me as if i am watching a movie .

    <article>washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- as he awaits a crucial progress report on iraq , president bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out . president bush pauses tuesday during a news conference at the north american leaders summit in canada . on wednesday in kansas city , missouri , bush will tell members of the veterans of foreign wars that `` then , as now , people argued that the real problem was america 's presence and that if we would just withdraw , the killing would end , '' according to speech excerpts released tuesday by the white house . `` three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left , '' bush will say . `` whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose __agonies__ would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , ' '' the president will say . the president will also make the argument that withdrawing from vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising u.s. credibility , citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam , according to the excerpts . `` here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , '' bush will say . on tuesday , democratic senate majority leader harry reid said , `` president bush 's attempt to compare the war in iraq to past military conflicts in east asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two . our nation was misled by the bush administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of iraq under false __pretenses__ , leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history . `` while the president continues to __stay-the-course__ with his failed strategy in iraq , paid for by the taxpayers , american lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the iraqi government . it is time to change direction in iraq , and congress will again work to do so in the fall . '' the white house is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the american legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in iraq until the report comes out in september . watch bush criticize the iraqi government '' it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the white house to try to __reframe__ the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush in wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from asia , including the u.s. defeat and occupation of japan after world war ii and the korean war in the 1950s , according to the excerpts . `` in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' bush will say . `` today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies . '' speaking about the korean war , bush will note that at the time `` critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that america 's intervention was divisive here at home . '' `` while it is true that the korean war had its share of challenges , america never broke its word , '' bush will say . `` without america 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the south koreans after the war , millions of south koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime .

    <article>washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there is `` no remaining hope '' of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a utah coal mine alive , a federal official said saturday . isaac arellano holds a candle and sings during a fundraiser for miners tuesday in price , utah . `` over the past 25 days , the mine safety and health administration has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners , '' richard __stickler__ , head of the agency , said in a statement . `` the thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at __msha__ are with the families . '' sympathy for the failed efforts also came saturday from the white house . `` last night , a difficult decision was made to end the search , '' president bush said in a statement . `` laura and i are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men . '' labor secretary elaine chao called the ordeal `` heartbreaking . '' `` the grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community , and our thoughts and prayers are with them all , '' chao said in a statement . after drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above , there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no sound from the men . see a timeline of rescue efforts '' tests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life . `` we basically told the families that at this point in time we 've run out of options , '' __stickler__ said at a news conference late friday . `` we 've consulted with the people that we have here , we 've consulted with the technical support in pittsburgh and we 've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go , '' he said . `` and basically , through all the information we 've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found , in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else , we just do n't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information . '' see photos of the rescue mission '' there were no public statements saturday from bob murray , president and ceo of murray mining , co-owner of the crandall canyon mine , who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks , then largely disappeared from public view . federal officials became the spokesmen . no one from murray mining was present at friday 's news conference . `` they are done . it 's finished , '' the attorney for the families said , according to the saturday edition of the salt lake tribune . `` it 's a hard and bitter pill for our families , and there were quite a few tears shed , '' the newspaper quotes colin king as saying . the men were trapped during a collapse on august 6 , and it is not known whether they survived the __cave-in__ . efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed , and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working . murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole . under pressure from the families , however , he agreed to try one more time . families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule . the effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called `` a long shot '' by an official . __msha__ 's __stickler__ said that hole was drilled into the crandall canyon mine on thursday , but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it . work resumed friday , this time at the fourth hole , but the camera could only descend about 7 feet , he said . `` basically , what it saw was really not that much . there was quite a bit of mud in there , water coming down the hole . it really could n't go any farther than seven feet , '' he said of the latest try . in addition , the roof was sagging . `` the families asked many , many questions and we answered them all the best we could , basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options . '' murray said last saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the crandall canyon mine . `` i will never come back to that evil mountain , '' he said . friends and family have identified the six missing miners as luis hernandez , manuel sanchez , kerry allred , carlos __payan__ , brandon phillips and don erickson . e-mail to a friend .</article>
