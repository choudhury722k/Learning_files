    <article>england 's campaign at the european under 21 championship looks set to be dominated over whether harry kane is included - but gareth southgate may not need him . in front of over 30,000 at the riverside stadium , england came from behind to defeat germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the czech republic this summer . southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the tottenham striker , but the win over germany shows that the young lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of europe . here sportsmail looks at england 's three stand-out stars from the win in middlesbrough . james ward-prowse . the southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at st mary 's and is set to be a key member of southgate 's side in the czech republic . the 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after __ghosting__ into the penalty box to find space . but his attacking play extends to set-pieces . germany 's julian __korb__ reaches out in vain as james ward-prowse fires home england 's winning goal . the under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance . in ward-prowse , england have potentially their best __dead-ball__ specialist since david beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game . ward-prowse was captain for the germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on . carl jenkinson . named the official man of the match , jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for germany 's opening goal after allowing the cross for philipp __hofmann__ to fire home . but after a slow start to each half , the west ham full-back , on loan from arsenal , imposed himself down the right-hand side . carl jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for england as germany substitute nico schulz looks on . jenkinson put in a man of the match display having assisted two of england 's three goals . it was the 23-year-old 's cross for jesse lingard which helped draw the three lions level in the first half , while he also provided the pass for ward-prowse to tuck home the winning goal . with england 's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area , roy hodgson could do worse than pick jenkinson . because if he does n't , then finland will as he can still play for the scandinavian team . nathan redmond . relished the battle with germany full-back christian gunter , often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing . redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach , with his passing in the final third managing to catch the german back four flat on a number of occasions . nathan redmond rifles home england 's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner . redmond celebrates after drawing england level late in the game following an impressive display on the right . it was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor norwich side in the premier league last season , but having struck the equaliser against a talented germany team he looks to be improving . now a veteran of the under 21 set-up , it will be difficult for southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the young lions .</article>

    <article>rangers boss stuart mccall says he feels sorry for newcastle loanee gael __bigirimana__ , but admits he should never have been signed by the ibrox club . __burundi-born__ england youth cap __bigirimana__ has yet to feature for the light blues after being diagnosed with a mystery illness . he was one of five magpies youngsters signed by former light blues chief executive derek llambias without being put through a medical - even though __bigirimana__ knew he was sick before signing for the glasgow giants . gael __bigirimana__ has not played for rangers since his loan move from newcastle . the 21-year-old has denied rumours claiming he is suffering from __hepatitis-c__ , but __gers__ boss mccall confirmed his condition means he will not be able to feature for his adopted club . the former motherwell manager would love to have the use of the former coventry midfielder 's services , but believes he should never have been allowed to make the move north in the first place . ` __bigi__ has got a medical condition which is a personal matter , ' said mccall . ` the doctor and consultant are all involved in that . ' i knew him at coventry . i remember watching him and thought when i came into the job he will be a good one to bring in and give us a bit of energy . unfortunately because of his medical condition he wo n't be able to play for us . __bigirimana__ signed on loan for rangers alongside haris __vuckic__ -lrb- middle -rrb- and __remie__ __streete__ . ` but that is as big a blow to the kid as it is for us . it 's not his fault , this -lsb- row -rsb- has been nothing to do with him . he comes in with a smile on his face each morning , he trains with the fitness coach as hard as he possibly can . ` so as disappointed as we are that we ca n't use him , you have to think of the boy in this matter because he ca n't go back , he ca n't play for anyone else . ` it 's an unfortunate circumstance that really should never have happened . ' llambias - a close associate of magpies owner mike ashley - signed off on the five newcastle loan deals just hours before the january transfer window shut , but did not ask club doctors to check the players over . so far only slovenian playmaker haris __vuckic__ has played regularly . __bigirimana__ says he knew he was ill before he moved to rangers . defender __remie__ __streete__ limped off just half an hour into his debut and has not been seen since , while northern ireland winger shane ferguson has yet to even step foot inside murray park after being ruled out for the rest of the season with a serious knee injury . swiss defender kevin __mbabu__ has featured for rangers ' youth side but is ` nowhere ' near being fit enough for first-team duty , according to mccall . the __gers__ boss cans sympathise with the players but hit out at the previous regime 's decision to sanction some of the signings . rangers boss stuart mccall says he feels sorry for newcastle loanee __bigirimana__ . mccall said : ` should these guys ever have been sent here ? well , with __bigi__ being unable to play that 's a no-brainer . with shane , he was on his way back but had a little setback . ` but i think if you look at it in all honesty , anybody who comes up for a six-month loan should have a medical - obviously that is not the case . ` if that had occurred , two or three of the loans may not have happened . ` but none of the players are at fault here . shane has not been up but the rest come in and train as hard as they can . they are doing their utmost to be involved .

    <article>wayne rooney has warned harry kane not to let his full england debut be ruined by dirty tricks from italy 's defenders . england manager roy hodgson confirmed on monday night that the young tottenham star will definitely be unleashed from the start in tonight 's friendly in turin . phil jones is expected to operate in midfield as hodgson __tinkers__ with a team who have won seven out of seven this season , and theo walcott could return to the starting line-up . england captain wayne rooney has warned harry kane not let his full international debut be ruined by italy . kane celebrates after scoring his first international goal during england 's 4-0 victory over lithuania on friday . all eyes will be on kane , however , and hodgson spoke of the ` magic touch ' which has helped him score 30 goals this season , including his first for his country -- within 79 seconds of his debut from the bench against lithuania on friday . but england captain rooney , who is set to win his __103rd__ cap playing at the forward tip of a midfield diamond , warned kane what he should expect from the likes of giorgio chiellini and leonardo bonucci . rooney said : ` with italian defenders , they 're clever defenders . they do anything to try and stop you and you have to be aware of that , and not be frustrated . ` they 're a passionate country who love their football and they 're probably the closest in europe to south american teams . they 'll do anything to stop you . they 're tough to play against , organised , make it as difficult to play against as possible . they 're the best in europe at doing that . ` harry 's taking the ball and running at the defenders and getting shots at goal . ` that 's all he has to do , ' insisted rooney , who hopes to match tommy lawton 's record of scoring in six successive england games , set in __1938-39__ . ` i 'm sure if he does that the way he has , he 'll be fine . ' rooney insists italy 's defenders will do anything to stop the opposition and kane must be aware . kane will come up against leonardo bonucci -lrb- pictured -rrb- and giorgio chiellini on tuesday night . when italy beat england at the world cup in brazil , no-one thought kane anywhere near an international breakthrough - but he has made incredible progress . hodgson said : ` it 's great to see people like harry kane come on the scene and it 's a fairytale for him at the moment . he 's got the magic touch . within 80 seconds got a goal on his debut . it does n't get much better . this will be a tougher test , but he will start and hopefully play a large part in it . ` our system will be slightly different because we had a lot of forwards available for lithuania , but we lost raheem sterling and danny welbeck , which has changed my thinking . ` we still have what i consider to be a very offensive line-up . it 'll be hard work for the front six , who have a hard job on their hands . ' england manager roy hodgson -lrb- left -rrb- confirmed kane will start against italy and ` hopefully play a large part ' james milner and leighton baines have also withdrawn . meanwhile , welbeck is facing a race to be fit for arsenal 's crunch premier league match against liverpool on saturday . he returned to north london after sustaining a knee injury in friday 's win against lithuania . it is a blow for arsenal ahead of a game which could prove pivotal in the fight for a top-four finish . danny welbeck faces a race to be fit for arsenal 's premier league clash with liverpool on saturday .</article>

    <article>chester city striker oliver __mcburnie__ has vowed to prove scotland 's under __19s__ do n't need real madrid __superkid__ jack harper by firing ricky __sbragia__ 's youngsters to a winning start in their uefa elite round against hosts austria on thursday . __sbragia__ 's decision to omit the promising bernabeu talent for the tournament has caused uproar , mixed with bemusement , after the former sunderland boss ' comments about harper not being physically strong enough . harper 's replacement does not have zinedine zidane as a coach or the luxury of a five-year deal with real . in fact , __mcburnie__ is currently on loan from bradford city at football conference mid-table outfit chester city . on loan chesterfield striker is ready to step up for scotland under __19s__ against austria on thursday . __mcburnie__ in action for scotland under __19s__ against holland under __19s__ during an international challenge match . however , the 18-year-old is in agreement with __sbragia__ that scotland need to be physical in their three games which starts on thursday in vienna against hosts austria , before facing italy on saturday and croatia next week . and he 's had plenty of practice playing for chester against the likes of __alfreton__ town , dartford and lincoln city 's __grizzled__ defenders . __mcburnie__ said : ` obviously , jack has n't made the squad , but it 's good to know it ' s not just about reputations . if they do come and watch you and you do well then you get the rewards for that . ` the boys are confident and we know we have quality in this team and an ability to hurt the opposition . if we stick to the __game-plan__ and play how we know we can play we 've got a chance . it 's tough against the hosts , italy and croatia for that matter but we want to test ourselves against the best . ` they 're all good sides and hopefully we can go out there and prove a point . they 're going to be big and powerful sides but we see ourselves in that bracket as well . hopefully we can cope with that and let our football do the talking . real madrid youngster jack harper has been left out of the latest scotland under 19 squad . __mcburnie__ says that he has had to toughen up playing against conference opposition . ` you have to grow up fast and it 's very different to bradford , although chester like to try and play a bit to be fair . in the conference it 's tough to play football on some of the pitches against some of the teams . it 's a great learning experience and just adds to my game . the defenders have definitely tried to rough me up . ` the worst was at lincoln away . both of their centre-backs were about 6ft 6in and i was playing up front on my own . that was tough . but we got through and won , so i enjoy testing myself against bigger and stronger players . it 's a different experience . ' but the harper issue does bring back memories of a __depressingly__ frank admission from billy stark , then scotland under-21 boss , in june 2009 . a month earlier , xavi and iniesta had passed manchester united to death during the 2009 champions league final at rome 's stadio olimpico . recalling a community coaching forum at hampden 24 hours before , stark said : ' i was asked whether iniesta and xavi would have flourished and come through the scottish system . ` it 's hard to say because you 're looking at two different cultures but the answer is - probably not . the spanish place an emphasis on sheer technique and movement . our game is based more on power and pace . so there 's an argument that they would n't have come through in this country to become the players they are now . scotland under __19s__ manager ricky __sbragia__ claimed harper is not big enough physically . harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with real madrid and is tipped to have a big future . ` but the spanish approach is working for them and it deserves to be copied , ' he added . former scotland manager craig brown has urged caution in the rush to condemn the under-fire __sbragia__ . ` i 've the greatest of admiration for ricky as a man and a coach , ' said the 74-year-old . ` my friend archie knox speaks highly of him and he 's also worked under sir alex ferguson at manchester united . so i 'd like to hear more on the context of the words spoken by him -lrb- about jack harper -rrb- . ` but i would say this : people are saying this young lad is a real madrid player . he 's not ; he 's never played for real madrid . i was a rangers signing but i never played for rangers . ` real madrid will have hundreds of kids in their system . i 'm not for a minute saying jack harper is not a good player . i have n't seen him so i do n't know . former scotland boss craig brown -lrb- second right -rrb- revealed his admiration for under 19 coach __sbragia__ . ` but i think people get hypnotised by the name real madrid . there 's a frenzy going on but if -lrb- the same player -rrb- played for another club would there be the same impact ? ' brown admitted it is an occupational hazard of a national youth selector to end up looking foolish . ` you ca n't get every player right , ' he said . ` here 's my example : when i was scotland under 21 manager , i got a phone call from the late alex wright , manager of dumbarton , saying he had a good player for me . it was owen coyle , and he was good , but i did n't think he was as good as kevin gallacher and gordon __durie__ . ' i told alex the only reason i would be picking owen would be solely to prevent ireland getting him -- and that would be unfair . he would have been a bench player for scotland . ` so the irish picked him instead and our next game was against ireland at easter road . my __over-age__ centre half that day was alex mcleish and owen knocked the ball past alex and stuck it in the roof of his net . ' i remember thinking ` i 've messed up here ' . but we ended up winning 4-1 and i think __durie__ scored three . but you can get egg on your face ... '</article>

    <article>relentless robbie neilson celebrated hearts clinching the championship title in march -- then ordered his team to smash hibs ' second-tier record points total . an unexpected 2-0 win for rangers at easter road yesterday left the tynecastle side -- who had beaten falkirk 3-0 at westfield 24 hours earlier -- an unassailable 23 points clear of hibs with 21 points left on the board . neilson learned his team had secured a return to the premiership without kicking a ball while he was studying for his pro licence at stirling university yesterday afternoon . robbie neilson wants his hearts team to surpass hibernian 's second-tier points total . hearts ended up securing their title a day after a 3-0 win against falkirk . rangers beat hibernian to give hearts an unassailable advantage at the top of the league . but , despite the league being finally in the bag , the 34-year-old vowed there will be no __let-up__ as hearts hope to usurp hibs ' record tally of 89 points , set under alex mcleish in 1999 . should his team rise to his challenge of winning their remaining seven matches , the rampant __gorgie__ outfit would end the season with a remarkable 99 points . ` it 's a fantastic achievement to win the league . it 's a great day for the club , ' said neilson . ` the objective for the season was to get promoted . we 've done that and that will give us a head start in planning for next season -- but we need to keep winning games . ` we 've got seven games left and we want maximum points . we wo n't be losing focus . if we could set a new record for points for the division , then that would be fantastic . ` when you play for a club with the stature of hearts , you have to keep winning games -- and that 's what we need to do . ` i will rotate the squad and some guys will get game time but you have to win games . we ca n't be turning up at venues and losing games . we want to win , starting with three more points against queen of the south at tynecastle next weekend . ' neilson believes his side 's 2-1 stoppage-time win at ibrox against rangers on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign . but it was n't until a battling 2-1 victory at queen of the south on february 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away . ` i do n't think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line , ' he said . ` but i think that queen of the south game was a big one for us away from home . we went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points . we eventually got there and , from then on , i thought we had a real chance of taking the league . ` but that win against rangers on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans . a lot of times you can go to ibrox , go ahead and then rangers draw level and you 're then hoping to hang on for a draw . hearts ' __genero__ __zeefuik__ celebrates after giving his side two-goal lead against falkirk . the hearts players celebrate as they beat falkirk and edged closer to an impressive title win . ` but we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season . it gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we 've done it . ` to finally get over the line is magnificent . the players have worked so hard and i could n't have asked for more . ` we can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate . we 've got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them . ` it 's just a great day and it 's testament to the support we 've had all season from the fans , the hard work of -lrb- owner -rrb- ann budge and -lrb- director of football -rrb- craig __levein__ and all the players . ` the fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks . ' meanwhile , hearts captain danny wilson admitted it was a relief to finally get over the line after months of being billed as __champions-in-waiting__ . hearts captain danny wilson revealed his joy after his side became scottish championship winners . ` it has been difficult , you know , ' he said . ` since maybe late december and early january people have had us installed as champions . so it 's been tough , not so much to keep your standards up but to put all that talk to one side . but we 've done that . ` the way the season has panned out , we 've been going about our business in the right fashion . but if you had asked me at the start of the season whether i thought the gap would have been this big , i probably would n't have believed you .
